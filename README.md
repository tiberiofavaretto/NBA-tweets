# NBA-tweets

In this R file, I analyze the tweets regarding the NBA for the 2019-2020 NBA season. In particular I consider the month of December 2019, because it is one of the most important month of the league, and the months from August to October 2020, that are the months in which the Playoffs took place because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

I search for trends and frequent terms among teams and players.

Have fun!
